Welcome to the Book-worm-forum!
This here is a template website and is great practice for dealing with text-inputs, users, admin users, and form submission.

Dev-to-do

Even though i prefer to code in the TypeScript stack,
JavaScript, Mongoose, create-react-app, and axios are industry standards that cannot be ignored
